This build has the follwing feature
 
-  Static Distpatcher
-  Static Sample clients  (Samson and CMD0)  using a single PeerClient
-  Single Job on system


The Peer Client is a codle that all models and most services will be written to.
This works very well. Any issues are with the model iteractiona and sharing variables.

The Samson Client is a good starting point for testing an archtecture. I envision
that is used for testing a the event models. Currently it does not shutdown correctly,
nor do the Message "unregister" from the database.  This will be addressed vof build 0.1

The CMD Client is a good staring point for seperating out the CMD models.  This uses
the even structure from the Samson Client, so has the same issues.  

Short Term Issues

- Debug Objects from the Main Shared Object is not being read correctly int Model (which
is loaded as Dynamic Shared Object).  Understanding why is important for sharing data
between the PeerClient and the Model.

- GCC V4.X  has changed the way shared library visibility works.  This is not completely
understood at this time and has resulted in work-arounds rather than a unified approach.

- The event structure and time in the Samson Client interaction messages is not consistent.
This points to a memory leak.  This model is a good strawman interaction model.

- Models need to read data in from exteral files, the format and reader is TBD.  XML is
preferred for most values, but the CMD reader will be used for its data for the first version.

- VAT is not working properly, nor it is under version control.  It does not seem to 
work with outside of the "example" directory, nor with the later versions of its dependent
library packages.
