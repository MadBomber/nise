This test directory contains the test routines that have been created
to verify the functionality of the library files contained in the
parent directory.

It is appropriate in this directory to put a Rakefile or other helper
files that can be shared between the various test files.  The subdirectory
'unit' contains test routines that perform unit-level testing on the
libraries.
