#

This directory contains the unit tests for the library
files that are contained in the ../.. (grand-parent) directory.

Common routines can be placed in the parent directory.  For example
a helper file that executes all of the unit test programs would be
appropriate in that directory.

The test/unit directory should contain files that are named with a convention
that uses either a prefix of 'test_' or a sufix of '_test' to the library file
which the file is directed.
