#

The Models directory contains all of the IseModels used by the
<%= project_name %> project.  Each model implemented in C++ is
located in its own sub-directory.  The directory naming convention uses
CamelCase for the names of these sub-directories.

Models implemented in the Ruby programming language are all located
under the RubyModels sub-directory.  See the README.txt file in that
directory for additional information.

Models implemented in the Java programming language are all located
under the JavaModels sub-directory.  See the README.txt file in that
directory for additional information.

It is appropriate for this file to list the models used by the
<%= project_name %> project with a brief description of what each
model does.
