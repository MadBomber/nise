This directory contains informal documentation of a technical
nature.  It can be used to explain design choices, trade-offs or
any stray thought that might come into the head of a software
developer.

As an informal collection these notes are __NOT__ intended for publication.
They may, and most likely will, contain source material from which formal
documentation is generated.
